 *
 * The CORDET Framework defines an interface for reporting the outcome of an
 * InCommand (see <code>CrFwRepInCmdOutcome.h</code>).
 * A stub implementation for this interface is provided in <code>CrFwRepInCmdOutcomeStub.c</code>.
 * The present module defines the public functions which are implemented by
 * <code>CrFwRepInCmdOutcome.c</code> but which are not declared in <code>CrFwRepInCmdOutcome.h</code>.
 * Thus, the complete interface of the InCommand outcome reporting stub of
 * <code>CrFwRepInCmdOutcomeStub.c</code> is provided in:
 * - <code>CrFwRepInCmdOutcome.h</code> (interface defined at framework level)
 * - this module (interface defined for testing purposes)
 * .
