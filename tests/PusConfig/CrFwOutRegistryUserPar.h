/**
 * Definition of the range of out-going services supported by an application.
 * An application supports a number of service types and, for each service
 * type, it supports a number of sub-types.
 * Each sub-type may support a range of discriminant values.
 * Each line in this initializer defines one [type,sub-type] pair supported by
 * the application.
 * The fields in the initializer are as follows:
 * - The service type
 * - The service sub-type
 * - The lower bound l of the range of discriminant values associated to the
 * [type,sub-type] pair
 * - The upper bound u of the range of discriminant values associated to the
 * [type,sub-type] pair
 * - Four values used internally by the software which must be set to zero
 * .
 * If a [type,sub-type] pair does not support a discriminant, then l and u are
 * set to zero.
 * The list of service descriptors satisfies the following constraints:
 * - The number of lines must be the same as
 * <code>#CR_FW_OUTREGISTRY_NSERV</code>.
 * - The service types must be listed in increasing order.
 * - The service sub-types within a service type must be listed in increasing
 * order.
 * - The set of service type and sub-types must be consistent with the service
 * types and sub-types declared in the
 * <code>#CR_FW_OUTCMP_INIT_KIND_DESC</code> initializer.
 * - The lower bound l of a range of discriminant values must be smaller than
 * or equal to the upper bound u.
 * .
 * Compliance with the last four constraints is checked by
 * <code>::CrFwAuxOutRegistryConfigCheck</code>.
