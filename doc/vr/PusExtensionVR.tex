\subsection{Framework Constituents}\label{sec:svrConstituents}
For the purposes of assessing the qualification status of the PUS Extension of the CORDET Framework, it is useful to divide its code into the constituent parts listed in table \ref{tab:ConstParts}. The second column in the table identifies the generation method of each component and is one of: (a) 'Reused', if the component is imported into the PUS Extension of the CORDET Framework without changes; (b) 'Generated', if the component is auto-coded; or (c) 'Manual', if the component is developed manually. The third column in the table gives the qualification status of the component which is either 'Qualified', if sufficient verification evidence is already available for the component, or 'To Be Qualified', if the component must be verified within the PUS Extension of the CORDET Framework Project itself.

%--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{Open Issues}\label{sec:svrOpenIssues}
An \textit{Open Issue} is an issue whose resolution may have an impact on the design or implementation of the framework. The open issues are tracked in the framework's GitHub project.

\section{Requirement Traceability}\label{sec:svrReqTr} 
The PUS Extension of the CORDET Framework is specified in reference [CR-SP]. The framework is specified in terms of three kinds of requirements:

\begin{itemize}
\item{} \textit{Standard Requirements} which define a desired feature of the framework extension. They are analogous in scope and format to the user requirements of a conventional (non-framework) application.
\item{} \textit{Adaptation Requirement} which define the points where a component offered by the framework extension can be extended by the application developers. In some cases, the definition of an adaptation point is accompanied by the definition of the default options offered by the framework extension for that adaptation point.  
\item{} \textit{Use Constraint Requirements} which define the constraints on how the components offered by the framework extension may be used by application developers.
\end{itemize}

Table \ref{tab:SReqTrace} shows how each Standard Requirement is implemented in the framework code. 

The Adaptation Points are of two kinds: adaptation points which are inherited from the CORDET Framework and new adaptation points which are defined by the PUS Extension. The new adaptation points are those with an identifier of the form Sx. Table \ref{tab:AReqTrace} lists both kinds of adaptation points and shows how each is mapped to code. Note that, in the case of adaptation points which are inherited from the CORDET Framework and are closed by the PUS Extension, the mapping to code takes the form of a pointer to a code-level module where the close-out is done; in the case of new adaptation points, instead, the mapping to code takes the form of a statement explaining how the adaptation point can be closed at code level by an application.

The Use Constraint Requirements are not mapped to code.

%==========================================================================================
\section{Requirement Verification}\label{sec:svrReqVer} 
The PUS Extension of the CORDET Framework is specified in reference [PX-SP] through a set of requirements of the following kinds:

\begin{itemize}
\item{} \textit{Standard Requirements} which define a desired feature of the framework extension. They are analogous in scope and format to the user requirements of a conventional (non-framework) application.
\item{} \textit{Adaptation Requirement} which define the points where a component offered by the framework extension can be extended by the application developers. In some cases, the definition of an adaptation point is accompanied by the definition of the default options offered by the framework extension for that adaptation point.  
\item{} \textit{Use Constraint Requirements} which define the constraints on how the components offered by the framework extension may be used by application developers.
\end{itemize}

The Use Constraint Requirements and the Adaptation Requirements are not directly verified. The standard requirements are often formulated in terms of expected behaviour for the commands and reports supported by the PUS Extension. Hence, the following verification evidence is provided for them:

\begin{itemize}
\item Section \ref{sec:svrVerStdReq} traces each standard requirement to its verification evidence
\item Section \ref{sec:svrVerCmdReps} traces each command or report supported by the PUS Extension to the test cases which verify it
\item Section \ref{sec:svrVerDataPool} traces the data pool items to the test cases which verify them
\item Section \ref{sec:svrCmdRej} traces the command rejection codes to the test cases which verify them
\item Section \ref{sec:svrVerProc} traces each FW Profile procedure used by the PUS Extension to the test cases which verify it
\end{itemize}





%------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{Verification of Standard Requirements}\label{sec:svrVerStdReq}
Table \ref{tab:SReqVerTrace} lists the standard requirements of the PUS Extension and provides for each requirement its verification evidence.


%------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{Verification of Commands and Reports}\label{sec:svrVerCmdReps}
The PUS Extension defines the behaviour of the commands and the reports supported by the PUS Extension. The PUS Extension is built on the CORDET Framework. In the CORDET world, 'command' and 'reports' are defined through: (a) their \textit{parameters}; (b) the \textit{actions} they perform during their execution; and (c) the \textit{conditional checks} which determine whether and when these actions are executed. 

The CORDET Framework defines the life-cycle of a generic command or report in terms of these parameters, actions and checks. The PUS Extension defines concrete commands and reports by specifying the name and type of their parameters and the content of their actions and checks. This is done through tables like the one shown in figure \ref{fig:InCmdHkCreHkCmdSpec}. 

\printInCmdHkCreHkCmdSpec{|c|p{10cm}|}

For all actions and checks, a default implementation is defined at CORDET Framework level. Wherever possible, the definition of a concrete command or report by the PUS Extension makes use of these default implementations. The default implementations are already verified at CORDET Framework level. Hence, Verification at PUS Extension level only needs to cover the non-default actions and checks and the commands or report parameters.

Tables \ref{tab:VerCmd} and \ref{tab:VerRep} list the commands and reports implemented by the PUS Extension and map them to the test case which verify them. In most cases, more than one test case is used to cover each command or report because different test cases cover different aspects of the of the command's or report's behaviour. Note that the guarantee of coverage of all non-default actions and checks is provided by the code coverage analysis in section \ref{sec:svrCodeCov}.

The implementation of the functions which access the command and report parameters is generated automatically from the description of the command and report layout (see reference [PX-IC]). Verification of correctness is done implicitly through the test cases listed in tables \ref{tab:VerCmd} and \ref{tab:VerRep} which must access the command and report parameters in order to verify their behaviour.


%------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{Verification of Data Pool}\label{sec:svrVerDataPool}
Table \ref{tab:VerDataPool} lists the data pool items for which dedicated verification tests are done in the test suite and associates to each data pool item the test case the item is verified. Coverage is not complete but this is acceptable because the functions to access the data pool items are generated automatically from the data pool description.


%------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{Verification of Command Rejection Codes}\label{sec:svrVerCmdRej}
Table \ref{tab:VerCmdRej} lists the command rejections codes for which dedicated verification tests are done in the test suite and associates to each command rejection code the test case the code is verified. 

%------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{Verification of FW Profile Procedures}\label{sec:svrVerProc}
Part of the behaviour of the PUS Extension is specified through FW Profile procedures. Table \ref{tab:VerProc} lists the procedures and the test cases where they are verified. All branches of the procedures are covered by the test cases. 

%------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{Verification of Design-Level Functions}\label{sec:svrVerFunc}
The PUS Extension requirements define a small number of design-level functions.  Table \ref{tab:VerFunc} lists them and associates them to the test cases which verify them. If a function operates uder different conditions, all conditions are verified.

%==========================================================================================
\section{Static Code Analysis}\label{sec:svrStaticCodeAna}
Two forms of static code analysis were done:

\begin{itemize}
\item Compilation of the PUS Extension of the CORDET Framework with the \texttt{clang} compiler with all warnings enabled
\item Compilation with the \texttt{clang} static analyzer (\texttt{scan-build})
\end{itemize}

The \texttt{clang} compiler does not report any errors.

The \texttt{scan-build} reports no errors in the PUS Extension code.

Based on the above, it is concluded that no statically detectable issues are present in the code of the PUS Extension of the CORDET Framework.







%==========================================================================================
\section{Code Coverage}\label{sec:svrCodeCov}
Code coverage is measured using the \texttt{gcov} tool. The main page of the Doxygen documentation for the PUS Extension of the CORDET Framework gives access to the coverage web page generated by the \texttt{lcov} tool. For convenience, figure \ref{fig:LcovCodeCovReport} shows the summary report from the \texttt{lcov} tool. The coverage information was derived by running the Test Suite (see section \ref{sec:TestSuite} in reference [PX-UM]).

In order to facilitate the assessment of branch coverage information, the following was done:

\begin{itemize}
\item The library source code is compiled with no optimization (compiler option \texttt{-o0}
\item The conditions in \texttt{if-clauses} consist of primitive boolean conditions. This means that condition coverage becomes equivalent to decision coverage.
\end{itemize}  

Note that the code in the \texttt{DataPool} and \texttt{Pckt} subdirectory is generated automatically by the CORDET Editor and consists mostly of getter and setter functions.


\begin{landscape}
\pnpfigure[scale=0.55]{Summary Coverage Report of \texttt{lcov} Tool}{fig:LcovCodeCovReport}{LcovCodeCovReport.png}
\end{landscape}




%==========================================================================================
\section{Unit-Level Tests}\label{sec:svrUnitLeveTests}
The unit level tests are implemented in the Test Suite described in section \ref{sec:TestSuite} of reference [PX-UM]. The outcome of running the entire test suite is in the log file \texttt{/log/TestSuiteRun.log}. Inspecton of this log file shows that all test cases in the test suite have been successfully passed.


%==========================================================================================
\section{Comment Coverage}\label{sec:svrCommCov}
The code of the PUS Extension of the CORDET Framework is documented using doxygen comments. The verification of the coverage of these comments is done as follows:

\begin{itemize}
\item Doxygen is configured to issue a warning in case any coding item is not documented
\item It is verified that warnings issue by Doxygen are justified
\end{itemize}

The outcome of this verification activity can be checked in file \texttt{/logs/Doxygen.out} in the delivery file which holds the output of the execution of Doxygen. The following warnings are issued by Doxygen:

\begin{itemize}
\item Warning "...too many nodes. Consider increasing DOT_GRAPH_MAX_NODES"
\item Warning for undocumented members for functions \texttt{CrPsTestOnBoardConnectionPrgrN1} and \texttt{CrPsHkConfigGetParamId}
\item Warning "return type of member __attribute__ is not documented"
\end{itemize}

The first and third warnings are accepted. The reason for the second warning is instead not understood.


%==========================================================================================
\section{Memory Management}\label{sec:svrMemMng}
Verification of absence of memory leaks is done at two levels:

\begin{itemize}
\item Statically, the only statements resulting in an allocation of memory from the heap are those where FW Profile state machine or procedures are created but these objects are only created during the application initialization phase (in the \texttt{config} modules) and are never destroyed afterwards
\item Dynamically, \texttt{Valgrind} reports no memory leaks during the execution of the Test Suite for the PUS Extension of the CORDET Framework. The outcome of running the entire test suite is in the log file \texttt{/log/TestSuiteRunWithValgrind.log}.
\end{itemize}

Based on these considerations, it is concluded that there are no memory leaks in the PUS Extension of the CORDET Framework.

No measurement has been made of stack usage but it is stressed that the PUS Extension of the CORDET Framework does not make any recursive function calls\footnote{Recursion is used in the FW Profile Library but, in that case, the depth of recursion is the same as the depth of nesting of state machines.}.



%==========================================================================================
\section{Schedulability}\label{sec:svrSched}
The PUS Extension of the CORDET Framework is not a self-standing executable. Hence, it does not make sense to ask whether the framework is schedulable \textit{per se}. The more relevant question is: does the library support the analysis of the schedulability of the application within which it is embedded? This question can be split into the following sub-questions:

\begin{itemize}
\item Is the threading model implemented by the framework compatible with application-level schedulability analysis?
\item Is the execution time of framework code well characterized?
\end{itemize}

The answer to the first question is provided in section 21 of the User Manual of the CORDET Framework.

The answer to the second question would require timing measurements to be done on the framework code. No such measurements have yet been done. In any case, these measurements would have to be done on the final target where the application instantiated from the framework runs. 



%==========================================================================================
\section{Metrics}\label{sec:svrMetrics}
The fist sub-section presents the software metrics. The second sub-section presents the process metrics.

%-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{Software Metrics}\label{sec:svrSwMetrics}
Software metrics were computed with the aim of measuring the complexity of the code. The tool used to compute the software metrics was \texttt{lizard} version 1.14.10. Its output is in the log file \texttt{Metrics.log} in the \texttt{log} directory of the delivery file.

Table \ref{tab:swMetrics} lists the software metrics and their values. The following considerations apply:

\begin{itemize}
\item Metrics SM1 to SM5 refer to the PUS Extension code excluding the CORDET Framework and FW Profile code
\item Metrics SM2.1 to SM2.4 refer to the the PUS Extension code excluding the the CORDET Framework and FW Profile code and excluding the code generated by the CORDET Editor
\item The only function with CCN greater than 12 is \texttt{CrPsEvtConfigIter} which has a CCN of 18.
\item 
\end{itemize}

\begin{pnptable}{|c|>{\raggedright\arraybackslash}p{8cm}|c|}{\chgA{Software Metrics}}{tab:swMetrics}{ID & Metrics Name & Value}
SM1 & Number of Lines of Code & 8779 \\
\hline
SM2 & Number of Functions & 1152 \\
\hline
SM3 & Average LOC per Function & 6.2  \\
\hline
SM4 & Average Cyclomatic Complexity Number (CCN) & 1.1 \\
\hline
SM5 & Number of Functions with CCN greater than 12 & 1 \\
\hline
SM2.1 & Number of Lines of Non-Editor Code  & 3420 \\
\hline
SM2.2 & Number of Non-Editor Functions & 222 \\
\hline
SM2.3 & Average LOC per Non-Editor Function & 10.2  \\
\hline
SM2.4 & Average Cyclomatic Complexity Number (CCN) for Non-Editor code & 1.6 \\
\hline
\end{pnptable}



%-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{Process Metrics}\label{sec:svrProcMetrics}
The process metrics tracked for this project are listed in table \ref{tab:prMetrics}. 

\begin{pnptable}{|c|>{\raggedright\arraybackslash}p{11cm}|c|}{\chgAA{Process Metrics}}{tab:prMetrics}{ID & Metrics Name & Value}
PM1 & Number of Open Issues (see section \ref{sec:svrOpenIssues}) & n.a. \\
\hline
PM2 & Number of Non-Conformances since Release 1.0 (see section \ref{sec:svrNonConformances}) & n.a. \\
\hline
PM3 & Number of Requirement Changes since Release 1.0 (see section \ref{sec:svrReqChanges}) & n.a.  \\
\hline
\end{pnptable}

The process metrics will only be collected after release 1.0 of the framework

%==========================================================================================
\section{Automatically Generated Code}\label{sec:svrAutoCode}
Two forms of code generations are used in the PUS Extension of the CORDET Framework:

\begin{itemize}
\item Part of the specification of the PUS Extension of the CORDET Framework is expressed through state machines and procedures compliant with the FW Profile. Their implementation is generated by the FW Profile Editor.
\item The layout of the commands and reports supported by the PUS Extension is defined in the CORDET Editor which generates the functions to access the command and report parameters.
\end{itemize}

These two forms of code generations are discussed in the next two sub-sections.

%-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{Generation by the FW Profile Editor}
The state machines and procedures used to specify the PUS Extension in reference [PX-SP] are built within the \textit{FW Profile Editor}. The FW Profile Editor is a web-based tool which supports the definition of state machines and procedures compliant with the FW Profile. The editor includes an auto-coding back-end which generates the C-code which creates and configures the state machines and procedures. The auto-generated modules in the PUS Extension of the CORDET Framework are those whose author in the doxygen comment at the top of the module is: "FW Profile code generator". Appendix \ref{sec:svrFwProfEd} gives an overview of the FW Profile Editor.

Use of an auto-coding approach has the following advantages:

\begin{fw_itemize}
\item Guarantee of consistency between specification and implementation 
\item Faster turn-around time 
\item Reduced verification effort 
\end{fw_itemize}

The first advantage follows from the fact that the implementation is directly and automatically derived from the specification. The second advantage follows from the fact that code is generated automatically which is faster than manual development. The gains in verification effort follow from the fact that generated code can be tested more quickly than manually crafted code (because errors are systematic and hence only coding patterns need to be verified). 

The software implementing the state machines and procedures consist of two parts:

\begin{enumerate}
\item The software in the FW Profile Library which implements the generic state machine and procedure behaviour; and
\item The software generated by the FW Profile Editor implementing the instantiation and configuration code for a state machine or procedure.
\end{enumerate}

The verification approach for the first item is discussed in section \ref{sec:svrExtLib}. For the second item the following considerations apply:

\begin{enumerate}
\item The generated code consists of a linear (no branching) sequence of functions calls; hence one single test provides full coverage of the entire generated code.
\item The functions called by the generated code are configuration functions provided by the FW Profile Library and the order in which they are called is either immaterial or, if it is subject to constraints, their violation leads to errors detected by a built-in consistency check (see next bullet).
\item The FW Profile Library provides functions \texttt{FwSmCheckRec} and \texttt{FwPrCheck} which perform extensive consistency checks on the configuration of, respectively, a state machine or a procedure; these functions detect errors such as omission of a configuration action or execution of a configuration action with invalid parameters. These functions are called as part of the start-up of the PUS Extension of the CORDET Framework (TBC).
\item Implementation errors in the code generation process are likely to result in systematic coding errors triggering major errors in the test suite for the PUS Extension of the CORDET Framework.
\item The test suite for the PUS Extension of the CORDET Framework (see section \ref{sec:svrUnitLeveTests}) covers every state and every transition of every state machine and every node and every branch of every procedure (see section \ref{sec:svrReqVer}. Thus, any configuration errors in a state machine or procedure would be caught by the test suite.
\end{enumerate}

Based on the above, it is concluded that the automatically generated code implementing the configuration of the state machines and procedures of the PUS Extension of the CORDET Framework can be considered to be adequately verified.

%-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{Generation by the CORDET Editor}
The layout of the commands and reports supported by the PUS Extension of the CORDET Framework is defined in the CORDET Editor. The CORDET Editor is a proprietary web-based tool which supports the definition of PUS-compliant applications. The editor includes an auto-coding back-end which generates the following implementation-level artifacts:

\begin{itemize}
\item The modules implementing the data pool (modules in directory \texttt{src/DataPool})
\item The modules implementing the functions to access the parameters in the supported commands and reports (modules in directory \texttt{src/Pckt})
\end{itemize}

Use of the auto-conding approach has the same advantages as in the case of the FW Profile Editor. The verification approach for this auto-generated code is as follows:

\begin{itemize}
\item The generated code consists of linear (no branching) sequences of statements; hence, for a given function, one single test provides full coverage of the entire generated code.
\item The Test Suite of the PUS Extension has a very high coverage of the generated code (see section \ref{sec:svrCodeCov})
\item Implementation errors in the code generation process are likely to result in systematic coding errors triggering major errors in the test suite for the PUS Extension of the CORDET Framework.
\end{itemize}

Based on the above, it is concluded that the code generated by the CORDET Editor can be considered to be adequately verified.


%==========================================================================================
\section{Qualification Status of External Libraries}\label{sec:svrExtLib}
The PUS Extension of the CORDET Framework uses two external libraries:

\begin{itemize}
\item The CORDET Framework library from reference [CR-SP]
\item The FW Profile Library from reference [FW-SP]
\end{itemize}

Both libraries are publicly available under the Mozilla Public Licence v2. This licence allows their code to be embedded within the PUS Extension of the CORDET Framework code without imposing any requirements on the latter. In fact, the full code of the two libraries is included in the delivery file of the PUS Extension of the CORDET Framework.

Both libraries are provided with an own qualification data package (downloable from references [CR-SP] and [FW-SP]) which covers the following items:

\begin{itemize}
\item A set of \textbf{Software Requirements} which formally specify the implementation
\item A set of \textbf{Behavioural Models} which describe the behaviour of the library components
\item An \textbf{Implementation Traceability Matrix} which shows how each requirement is implemented
\item A \textbf{Verification Traceability Matrix} which shows how the implementation of each requirement is verified
\item A \textbf{Validation Traceability Matrix} which justifies each requirement with respect to the intended use of the library
\item A \textbf{Test Suite} with 100\% statement, function, branch, and condition coverage for the entire library implementation (excluding error branches for system calls)
\item \textbf{Doxygen Documentation} covering the entire library source code
\item A \textbf{User Manual} which explains how the library should be used
\end{itemize}

It is also noted that the FW Profile Library has been successfully used in several industrial project and the CORDET Framework library has been successfully used in at least one on-board software project.

Based on the above evidence, it is concluded that the FW Profile Library and the CORDET Framework library have an adequate quality for use within the PUS Extension of the CORDET Framework.

\appendix
%==========================================================================================
\section{FW Profile Editor and Code Generator}\label{sec:svrFwProfEd}
This appendix describes the FW Profile Editor which is used to define the state machines and procedures which specify the behaviour of the PUS Extension of the CORDET Framework and to generate the code of the functions implementing this behaviour.

\subsection{Overview of FW Profile Editor}
The FW Profile Editor allows a user to draw a state machine or a procedure (activity diagram) in a web-based interface accessible from [FwProfEd]. The semantics of the state machines and procedures is that of the FW Profile of reference [FwProf]. Figure \ref{fig:FwProfileEditorScreenshot} shows a screenshot of the FW Profile Editor.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
 \centering
 \includegraphics[scale=0.4,keepaspectratio=true]{FwProfileEditorScreenshot.png}
 \caption{Screenshot of the Framework Profile Editor}
 \label{fig:FwProfileEditorScreenshot}
\end{figure}

For each state machine or procedures, the FW Profile Editor offers two "views": the "description view" and the "code view". Users can change between the code view and the description view using a switch in the web-based interface of the editor (see box at the bottom of the "Global Properties" palette in figure \ref{fig:FwProfileEditorScreenshot}).

The two views are illustrated in figures \ref{fig:TsOutCmdSm} and \ref{fig:TsOutCmdSmCode} through the example of the OutCommand State Machine. The description view is used as a specification in the USP of the PUS Extension of the CORDET Framework (see reference [TsUsp]). The actions and guards of the state machine are described through a specification of what they should do. The code view associates code to the actions and guards in the state machine. The code may either take the form of a function name or it may consist of valid C code which directly implements the function. In the example of figure \ref{fig:TsOutCmdSmCode}, the former option. Thus, for instance, \texttt{OutCmdPendingEntry} is the name of a function which implements the entry action of state PENDING in the OutCommand State Machine.

\subsection{Generated Code}
The code generated by the FW Profile Tool for each state machine or procedure consists of three files:

\begin{itemize}
\item A header file which declares the following two items: 
\begin{enumerate}
\item The function to instantiate and configure the state machine or procedure, and
\item Any additional functions implementing actions or guards of the state machine or procedure. 
\end{enumerate}
\item A body file which implements the function which instantiates and configures the state machine or procedure.
\item A dummy \texttt{main} program which instantiates and configures the state machine or procedure and sends a few commands to it. This main program is only intended for demonstration/testing purposes and is not integrated with the application code. 
\end{itemize}

As noted in the previous section, the FW Profile Editor also gives users the option to define the implementation of an action or guard by directly entering the implementing code through the tool interface. In that case, the tool also generates a private (\texttt{static}) function with the code provided by the user. 

The code generated by the FW Profile Editor must be linked with the FW Profile Library (the necessary \texttt{\#include} statements are automatically generated). The library consists of a set of C modules which implement the behaviour of a generic state machine or procedure. Use of this library means that the code generated by the editor only needs to implement the configuration of a state machine or procedure (as opposed to implementing the state machine transition logic or the procedure execution logic). 

For state machines, the configuration code consists of a linear sequence of function calls which "build" the state machine by adding states and transitions and attaching them their attributes (the state and transition actions and the transition guards). Similarly, the configuration of a procedure consists of a sequence of function calls which build the procedure by adding nodes and control flows and to it and attaching them their attributes (the node actions and the control flow guards). 

%-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{Use of Generated Code}
With the PUS Extension of the CORDET Framework, the auto-generated code is used to create and configure the state machines and procedures. The code must be linked with the manually written code of the PUS Extension of the CORDET Framework but does not need to manually modified in any way.  

The PUS Extension of the CORDET Framework code calls calls the \texttt{Create} function when it needs to instantiate a state machine or procedure. The \texttt{Create} function returns one instance of the state machine or procedure which is fully configured and ready to be used. No further interaction with the generated code is necessary.

\subsection{Summary of Mode of Use of FW Profile Editor}
The FW Profile Editor and its code generator are used as follows in the PUS Extension of the CORDET Framework:

\begin{fw_enumerate}
\item Specification of state machines and procedures using the "description view" of the FW Profile Editor. 
\item Definition of "code view" for the state machines and procedures within the FW Profile Editor. For each action or guard with non-default implementation, a function is defined and its name is entered in the tool. 
\item Generation of code using the FW Profile Editor code generator. For each state machine or procedure, two files are generated (one header file and one body file).
\item For each state machine or procedure, creation of a body file with the implementation of the functions implementing the non-default actions or guards of the state machine or procedure.
\end{fw_enumerate}
