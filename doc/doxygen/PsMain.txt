/**
* @mainpage Introduction
*
* The C2 Implementation is a C-language implementation of the <strong>CORDET Framework</strong>.
* The CORDET Framework is a software framework for service-oriented distributed embedded applications. 
* It defines an application in terms of the services it provides to 
* other applications and in terms of the services it uses from other applications.
* A <strong>service</strong> is implemented by a set of <strong>commands</strong> through which 
* an application is asked to 
* perform certain activities and by a set of <strong>reports</strong> through which an application 
* gives visibility over its internal state.
* The CORDET Framework defines the components to receive, send, distribute, and process commands and reports.
* The full documentation and code of the CORDET Framework is available from its
* <a href="http://www.pnp-software.com/cordetfw">project web site</a>.
*
* The CORDET Framework uses the same service concept as the <strong>Packet Utilization Standard</strong> (PUS).
* The PUS has been introduced by the European Space Agency (ESA) to define the protocol through which 
* on-board applications make their services available to each other and to the ground. 
* The CORDET Framework offers a <strong>PUS Extension</strong> which provides an implementation of the most commonly used
* PUS services.
* 
* The CORDET Framework is implementation-independent. 
* The C2 Implementation is a C-language implementation of its components. 
* Its main features are: 
* - <strong>Well-Defined Semantics</strong>: clearly and unambiguously defined behaviour. 
* - <strong>Minimal Memory and CPU Requirements</strong>: core module footprint of a few kBytes and efficient
*   implementation in C.
* - <strong>Excellent Scalability</strong>: code memory footprint and CPU demands are independent of 
*   number and size of command and report instances.
* - <strong>High Reliability</strong>: a test suite provides full code, branch, and condition coverage
*   (excluding error branches for system call errors).
* - <strong>Formal Specification</strong>: user requirements formally specify the implementation.
* - <strong>Requirement Traceability</strong>: all requirements are individually traced to their implementation 
*   and to verification evidence.
* - <strong>Documented Code</strong>: doxygen documentation for all the source code.
* .
* These characteristics make the C2 Implementation especially well-suited for use in <strong>mission-critical 
* applications</strong>.
*
* The CORDET Framework components are implemented using state machines and procedures (activity diagrams) 
* defined with the semantics of the <a href="http://www.pnp-software.com/fwprofile">FW Profile</a> (a UML profile 
* with simple and unambiguous semantics). 
* This doxygen web site does not cover the low-level code implementing the state machine and procedure
* behaviour (this is covered as part of the FW Profile implementation delivery).
