/**
* @mainpage Introduction
*
* The <a href="https://www.pnp-software.com/cordetfw">CORDET Framework</a> is a 
* software framework for service-oriented embedded applications. 
* The CORDET Framework uses the same service concept as the <strong>Packet Utilization Standard</strong> (PUS).
* The PUS has been introduced by the European Space Agency (ESA) to define the protocol through which 
* on-board applications make their services available to each other and to the ground. 
* A C-language implementation of the CORDET Framework is available from 
* <a href="https://github.com/pnp-software/cordetfw">here</a>.
*
* The CORDET Framework only covers the management of generic services but does not specify any concrete services. 
* The PUS pre-defines a number of services. 
* The <b>PUS Extension of the CORDET Framework</a> extends the CORDET Framework to support a subset of those services. 
*
* <h3>Test Suite</h3>
* The PUS Extension of the CORDET Framework is provided with a unit <i>test suite</i>.
* The test suite code is also covered by this web site (see @ref TestCases). 
* The items verified by the test suite are listed <a href="verify.html">here</a>.
* The <i>coverage information</i> for the test suite (as generated by <code>lcov</code>)
* can be accessed from <a href="../lcov/index.html">here</a>.
*
* <h3>State Machine and Procedure Code</h3>
* The PUS Extension of the CORDET Framework is partly specified through state machines
* and activity diagrams compliant with the 
* <b><a href="https://www.pnp-software.com/fwprofile/">FW Profile</a></b>.
* The PUS Extension of the CORDET Framework uses a C-language implementation of the 
* FW Profile to implement these state machines and procedures.
* Its code is not covered by this web site.
* Its doxygen documentation is available 
* <a href="https://www.pnp-software.com/fwprofile/download.html">here</a>.
*
* <h3>CORDET Framework Code</h3>
* The C-language implementation of the PUS Extension of the CORDET Framework uses the 
* C-language implementation of the CORDET Framework. 
* Its code is not covered by this web site.
* Its doxygen documentation is available 
* <a href="https://www.pnp-software.com/cordetfw/download.html">here</a>.
*
* <h3>CORDET Framework Editor</h3>
* The CORDET Framework Editor is a web-based tool for modelling PUS-based applications.
* It allows the services supported by a PUS application to be defined in terms of
* their commands and reports and it allows commands and reports to be defined in
* terms of the parameters they carry (syntactical definition) and in terms of the
* actions and checks which they perform (semantic definition).
* Some of the components provided by the PUS Extension have been automatically
* generated by the CORDET Framework Editor (see @ref gen_dp, @ref gen_cfw, and @ref gen_pck). 
*
* <h3>Support Documents</h3>
* The following <i>support documents</i> are available for the PUS Extension of the CORDET Framework:
* - The <a href="../PusExtension.pdf">Specification of the PUS Extension</a>
* - The <a href="../PusExtensionSUM.pdf">Software User Manual of the PUS Extension</a>
* - The <a href="../PusExtensionSVR.pdf">Software Verification Report of the PUS Extension</a>
