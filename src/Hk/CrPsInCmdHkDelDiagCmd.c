/**
 * Progress action of TC(3,4) HkDelDiagCmd.
 * The Structure Identifiers (SIDs) are processed in sequence and in the order
 * in which they are stored in the command. Each SID is processed in an
 * execution cycle. Each execution cycle counts as a progress step. At each
 * execution, the progress action performs the following actions:
 *
 * (a) If the SID is loaded in the Report Definition List (RDL), then: the
 * unknown SID is loaded into verFailData and the Success Outcome is set to
 * VER_ILL_SID
 * (b) If the SID is loaded in the RDL but is already enabled, the SID is
 * loaded into verFailData and the Success Outcome is set to VER_ENB_SID
 * (c) If the SID is loaded in the RDL and is disabled, then its definition is
 * deleted from the RDL
 * (d) The Completion Outcome of the action is set to 'completed' if all SIDs
 * carried by the command have been processed; otherwise it is set to 'not
 * completed'.
 * @param smDesc The state machine descriptor.
