/**
 * Ready check of TM(3,26) HkDiagRep.
 * The Ready Check performs the following actions:
 *
 * (a) If the report's cycle counter in the RDL is equal to the report's
 * period in the RDL, then the report's cycle counter in the RDL is reset to
 * zero
 * (b) If the report's cycle counter in the RDL is equal to zero and the
 * report is enabled in the RDL, then the outcome of the Ready Check is set
 * to: 'ready'; otherwise it is set to 'not ready'
 * (c) The report's cycle counter in the RDL is incremented by 1
 *
 * NB: This logic ensures that the report's cycle counter increments from zero
 * to the report's period and then is reset. The report is 'ready' when its
 * cycle counter is equal to zero. The report's cycle counter is initialized
 * to zero at application's initialization (for pre-defined reports) or when
 * the report is created (for dynamically defined commands)
 * @param smDesc The state machine descriptor.
 * @return The ready check result.
